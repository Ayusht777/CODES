// The fseek() function will move the file pointer to a file, based on the option that we give it.
// syntax: fseek(FILE* POINTER, int offset, int position);
/*
 specify the starting position (offset
 Here, position can take the following macro values:

    SEEK_SET -> We place the initial position at the start of the file, and shift from there.
    SEEK_CUR -> The initial position is taken at the current position of the existing file pointer.
    SEEK_END -> We place the initial position at the end of the file.
                If you shift the pointer from this position, you will reach EOF.
*/
// NOTE: In case of SEEK_END, the offset position is measured backwards,
// so weâ€™ll be moving from the end of the file!
